in many ways it feels like regression

<br><br>

moving back to the jmz line, which i lived off of when i first moved to new york, which is where everyone i knew at the time also lived, if not off gates, then kosciuszko or myrtle broadway or if they were younger or liked to party more, central. off flushing there is a mcdonald’s where isaiah and i once walked through a blizzard to get to—i had a tattoo appointment nearby—isaiah wanted spiked hot chocolate but we settled for watered down coffees and cookies and french fries and as we ate we smiled at each other under ugly fluorescents because we had just met we were having fun we were so new and i thought maybe i loved him, i really wanted to, maybe i did a little, but it never really fully happened, but not for lack of me trying.

somewhere off hart street grace and jacqueline lived in an apartment that they paid too much for and it had a roof that vaguely resembled a piano and not in a good way but not in a bad way either. i went to a party there once and met a writer with an old face but he was actually 20 because everyone there was actually 20 because they all went to the new school and this was the summer of shek wes and someone played mo bamba and the living room full of white kids exploded and i was drinking a limerita wondering how i got to be the oldest one in the room, though i guess jack was with me, and he's ten days older. he kept repeating that he felt weird so we left early and went to different apartments because we were both sleeping with people who lived only about a block away just in different directions and the next day we both came home and at the time i kept thinking how funny it was that i lived with jack because i didn't think he would actually move to new york with me but he did after a year of me talking about it and i think maybe it was just the consistency and the repetition that did it.

i used to work six days a week and two of those days i would take the j to lorimer where i would get off and walk down the stairs and down more stairs to the g to get to greenpoint where i batch edited event photos for this photographer. the other four days i would get on the j and eye the m train the whole way trying to see when was best to transfer because i needed to get to 13th and 6th and i hated transferring at essex to get on the f. on the best days the m would be waiting for me at myrtle broadway or would be following closely behind so i could hop off at marcy and only wait a minute or two. on the worst days i was 30 minutes late but towards the end of that job it didn't really matter i was pushing the limits of what was acceptable in the summer months when school was out i would walk out after four hours of my nine hour shift and that wouldn't matter once i did that and hopped on the train and met my sister in williamsburg and we bought expensive dairy free ice cream pints and ate them along the water. my sister was here that summer working at the starbucks on bedford and i helped find an apartment for her in bushwick which i secured after dropping that we were cantonese (hong kong specific) and the roommates were also and i think maybe just didn't want to rent to white people. she said they were really quiet and kept to themselves but one night the roommate who worked in flushing brought tong yuen back to the apartment and they all ate them together which my sister found really charming and i found that really charming also.

there was a halloween party the first year where jack and i dressed up like sunny side up eggs, he, because he didn't have his own costume idea, me, because i thought it would be cuter to show up as a pair of eggs, so the two of us got on the bus to ridgewood and crammed ourselves into my friend's tiny apartment and we knew a few people from dc but we didn't know a lot of people either and there was this strange british man with long hair who came with someone i knew from undergrad who i had gone on a date with earlier that week and the british man kept looking at the ladder in the backyard that went up to nowhere and after a few hours he got up and climbed to the top and the man i had gone on a date with said haha and later when i got home i texted him and asked him why his friend had such a death wish and he said well don't we all have a bit of a death drive? and i said not me i don't think, i have no desire to put myself in situations that might induce bodily harm. a week later we went to a bar on the border of bedstuy and bushwick and after three beers me and six beers him i watched him play a game of pool and lose badly even though he said he was good he rolled us two cigarettes each we walked back to his apartment near the kosciuszko stop where he drank more beers offered me one which i took but didn't want and then kissed me after a moment of silence and then we went to bed, and again in the middle of the night, nodded off a few times until i had to wake up at 7am to go home shower look somewhat presentable and then make it in time for my sunday work shift at the new school, where he was a grad student, and so later a few times he would drop by while i was working and ask questions about video cameras and i would answer them. for a while he would check in by sending texts at the beginning of every season "happy spring" if it was spring or "happy summer" if it was summer and he went through all the seasons for a full year and then eventually stopped, and though it took maybe two seasons for me to notice, once i did i started to miss it.

on wednesday mornings i used to love waking up going to bagel buffet on 13th and 6th to get a sausage egg and cheese i would add my own avocado slices and hot sauce once i got upstairs would put my feet up in front of me on the low table we used for testing equipment my two favorite student workers would show up ten minutes late or so and we would shoot the shit for four hours straight until one of them had class. grace was always talking about beyonce or her dance choreography or starting to see her on and off ex again though they always seems to be on and taylor was always talking about vaguer things like how to be a good friend or what she wanted out of work, what she wanted out of life, and watching them talk and bounce off each other reminded me of jeannie and how we used to have six out of eight classes together junior year of high school and would talk talk talk the entire time never running out of things to say and then after school she would drive me home and we would do homework for two more hours so we always spent more than eight hours every day together because if we weren't doing homework after school we were in charge of the knowledge bowl club and practicing because both of us loved knowing the answer to things and being right. it was around then that it became clear that she would become immensely successful because she did things and often without questioning them too much which is what you need to do to stick with anything for longer than a year, which i have failed to do since leaving high school, changing my major/minor every year in college, doing drastically different internships, never having a job for longer than one year, though i tried, at every point, very hard, to want to want the things that i thought i wanted, the target just kept moving because i think at my core i don't actually want things that are available to me under our current working conditions.

the first winter i was here i was too busy falling in love to notice that i had no money, that he also had no money, that we were both tired all the time from working so many hours and from asking people to give us more hours that all we did when were together was nap at odd hours and wake up early together when one of us had an early call time or early shift once he had to be in soho at 7am so we woke up at dawn got bodega coffees and pastries in bushwick hopped on the m and rode it into the city and as we went over the bridge everything turned a vibrant pink and we were freezing since neither of us could afford better jackets so we held onto each other and smiled at the window because we were bathed in color and everything felt enormously fake.
