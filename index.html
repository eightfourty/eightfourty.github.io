in many ways it feels like regression

<br><br>

moving back to the jmz line, which i lived off of when i first moved to new york, which is where everyone i knew at the time also lived, if not off gates, then kosciuszko or myrtle broadway or if they were younger or liked to party more, central. off flushing there is a mcdonald’s where isaiah and i once walked through a blizzard to get to—i had a tattoo appointment nearby—isaiah wanted spiked hot chocolate but we settled for watered down coffees and cookies and french fries and as we ate we smiled at each other under ugly fluorescents because we had just met we were having fun we were so new and i thought maybe i loved him, i really wanted to, maybe i did a little, but it never really fully happened, but not for lack of me trying.

somewhere off hart street grace and jacqueline lived in an apartment that they paid too much for and it had a roof that vaguely resembled a piano and not in a good way but not in a bad way either. i went to a party there once and met a writer with an old face but he was actually 20 because everyone there was actually 20 because they all went to the new school and this was the summer of shek wes and someone played mo bamba and the living room full of white kids exploded and i was drinking a limerita wondering how i got to be the oldest one in the room, though i guess jack was with me, and he's ten days older. he kept repeating that he felt weird so we left early and went to different apartments because we were both sleeping with people who lived only about a block away just in different directions and the next day we both came home and at the time i kept thinking how funny it was that i lived with jack because i didn't think he would actually move to new york with me but he did after a year of me talking about it and i think maybe it was just the consistency and the repetition that did it.

i used to work six days a week and two of those days i would take the j to lorimer where i would get off and walk down the stairs and down more stairs to the g to get to greenpoint where i batch edited event photos for this photographer. the other four days i would get on the j and eye the m train the whole way trying to see when was best to transfer because i needed to get to 13th and 6th and i hated transferring at essex to get on the f. on the best days the m would be waiting for me at myrtle broadway or would be following closely behind so i could hop off at marcy and only wait a minute or two. on the worst days i was 30 minutes late but towards the end of that job it didn't really matter i was pushing the limits of what was acceptable in the summer months when school was out i would walk out after four hours of my nine hour shift and that wouldn't matter once i did that and hopped on the train and met my sister in williamsburg and we bought expensive dairy free ice cream pints and ate them along the water. my sister was here that summer working at the starbucks on bedford and i helped find an apartment for her in bushwick which i secured after dropping that we were cantonese (hong kong specific) and the roommates were also and i think maybe just didn't want to rent to white people. she said they were really quiet and kept to themselves but one night the roommate who worked in flushing brought tong yuen back to the apartment and they all ate them together which my sister found really charming and i found that really charming also.
