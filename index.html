in many ways it feels like regression, moving back to be on the JMZ line, which i lived off of when i first moved to new york, which is where everyone i knew at the time also lived off of, if not also gates, then kosciusko or myrtle broadway or if they were younger or liked to party more, central. off of flushing there is a mcdonald’s where isaiah and i walked through a blizzard for—i had a tattoo appointment nearby—where isaiah wanted spiked hot chocolate but we settled for watered down coffees and cookies and french fries and we ate it all and smiled at each other under the bright fluorescents because everything was still new and everything was still fun and i thought maybe i could love him, because i really wanted to, and maybe i did, a little, but it never really fully happened, but not for lack of me trying.
