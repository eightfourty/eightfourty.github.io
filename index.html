there was a halloween party the first year where jack and i dressed up like sunny side up eggs, he, because he didn't have his own costume idea, me, because i thought it would be cuter to show up as a pair of eggs, so the two of us got on the bus to ridgewood and crammed ourselves into my friend's skinny apartment and we knew a few people from dc but we didn't know a lot of people either and there was this small british man with long hair who came with someone i knew from undergrad who i had gone on a date with earlier that week and the british man kept looking at the ladder in the backyard that went up to nowhere and after a few hours he got up and climbed to the top and the man i had gone on a date with said hah hah hah and later when i got home i texted him and asked why his friend had such a death wish and he said well don't we all have a bit of a death drive? and i said not me i don't think, i have no desire to put myself in situations that might induce bodily harm. 

<br><br>

a week later we went to a bar on the border of bedstuy and bushwick and after three beers me and six beers him i watched him play a game of pool and lose badly even though he said he was good he rolled us two cigarettes each we walked back to his apartment near the kosciuszko stop where he drank more beers offered me one which i took but didn't want and then kissed me after we both ran out of things to say and then we went to bed, and again in the middle of the night, and then i had to pee and i sat on the toilet and thought about how nothing mattered not even a little bit and i was drunk and afraid of death and also i really didn't want to puke. we nodded off a few times until i had to wake up at 6am to go home shower look somewhat presentable and then make it in time for my sunday work shift at the new school, where he was a grad student, and so later a few times he would drop by while i was working and ask questions about video cameras and i would answer them. for a while he would check in by sending texts at the beginning of every season "happy spring" if it was spring or "happy summer" if it was summer and he went through all the seasons for a full year and then eventually stopped, and though it took maybe two seasons for me to notice, once i did, i started to miss it.

on wednesday mornings i used to love waking up going to bagel buffet on 13th and 6th getting a sausage egg and cheese i would add my own avocado slices and hot sauce once i got upstairs and would put my feet up on the low table we used for testing equipment and my two favorite student workers would show up ten minutes later and we would shoot the shit for four hours straight until one of them had class. grace was always talking about her dance choreo or starting to see her on and off ex again though they always seemed to be on and taylor was always short on cash but always had a ton of weed and watching them talk and bounce off each other reminded me of jeannie and how we used to have six out of eight classes together junior year of high school and would talk talk talk the entire time never running out of things to say and then after school she would drive me home and we would do homework for two more hours so we always spent more than eight hours every day together because if we weren't doing homework we were in charge of the knowledge bowl club and practicing because both of us loved knowing the answers to things and being right. if we weren't running knowledge bowl then we were running track because we needed p.e. credits to graduate, not because either of us really enjoyed it. 

<br><br>

it was around then that it became clear that jeannie would become immensely successful because she did things well and often without questioning them too much so she would stick with things for longer than a year which i have failed to do since leaving high school changing my major/minor every year in college and doing internships that didn't relate to anything and never having a job for longer than one year, though i tried at every point to want to want the things that i thought i wanted, the target just kept moving because i spent too much time questioning everything and once i could see the possibility of getting good at something i would give up. whenever a path opened up for me i hated it i hated seeing clearly how i was supposed to progress how i was supposed to act until i reached some type of goal someone set for me that i never really agreed to. grace has since moved back to florida and is living with her mom and sister and swearing off men and taylor is somewhere on long island as a live in nanny for some rich asshole who may or may not be paying her enough. i see jeannie maybe once every two years and every time i see her i can't believe how familiar she sounds, how it feels like i carry the cadence of her voice in my head with me always.

the first winter i was here it snowed so much i was so cold and i was too busy falling in love with a dancer to notice that i had no money, that he had no money, that we were both tired all the time from working so many hours, from asking people to give us more hours that we were contantly napping together and waking up early when one of us had an early call time or shift. once he had to be in soho at 7am so we woke up at dawn got bodega coffees and pastries in bushwick hopped on the m and rode it into the city and as we went over the bridge everything turned a vibrant pink and we were freezing since neither of us could afford better jackets so we held onto each other and smiled at the window because we were bathed in color flying over the water and everything felt enormously fake. i wanted so badly at the time to want to want him more, the same way i wanted to want my job(s) more, wanted to want the way i was living more. once i gave up on him i gave up on wanting and once i gave up on wanting, the future ceased to exist. most days i don't know what i'm doing until i find myself doing it and only then am i able to gauge if i like it and if i'm even able to do anything about it. my possible futures are foggy so i think in terms of weeks, months if i'm luckyâ€”i put away money but not seriously and nothing i build or buy will last, definitely not the clothing since i gain and lose weight faster than i'm able to understand what i look like and with everything in my life fluctuating and lacking a sense of permanence it feels like i'm on borrowed or maybe stolen time. nothing is mine.

<br><br>

i am 26 and crying because a year ago was the last time i talked to peter when he wished me a happy birthday and i am crying because he didn't make it to 26 and never will and i am crying because the day doesn't mean anything to me anymore. on the other side of the world my dad celebrates with my grandpa because we share the same birthday but we know nothing about each other and his health continually declines and the borders are closed and i don't know when i'll be able to visit next. after two years down in flatbush i somehow found myself living a 20 minute walk from my first apartment in bedstuy so i walk the same streets i did when i first moved to new york when everything still felt like a possibility but now they just feel like streets with a murmur of memory and nothing can hurt me anymore. i take the same busses and trains and look at the same views out the same windows but i can't remember who i spent that year with because everyone moved away. i know this is temporary the feeling the disconnect the lack of imagination the inability to see anything clearly but right now all i can focus on is dirt and earth and wanting to dig into it and smell it and feel part of it. i want to live inside the feeling of standing in sand as the ocean pulls away and threatens to take the ground beneath me with it. i want to drown in a heavy storm cloud and i want to dry out in warm orange light, until i grow cracks and shatter into pieces at even the suggestion of sound.
